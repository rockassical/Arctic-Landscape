Welcome! Our models initially come with customized Built-In (SRP) shaders. Depending on the package you choose, we have also created custom shaders (water, glass, etc.) in Built-In, URP and HDRP variants.

1. Package "Built-In_to_URP.unitypackage".
For your convenience, we have created a .unitypackage called "Built-In_to_URP". This package automatically changes the shaders of all materials from Built-In to URP. To install this package:
- Open your project in Unity.
- Go to the Assets menu and open the "Render_Pipeline_Convert" folder.
- Double click on the "Built-In_to_URP" file.
- Click the "Import" button.
After .unitypackage makes the changes to the materials it will change the Built-In shader to URP.

2. Package "Built-In_to_HDRP.unitypackage".
For your convenience, we have created a .unitypackage called "Built-In_to_HDRP". This package automatically changes the shaders of all materials from Built-In to HDRP. To install this package:
- Open your project in Unity.
- Go to the Assets menu and open the "Render_Pipeline_Convert" folder.
- Double click on the "Built-In_to_HDRP" file.
- Click the "Import" button.
After .unitypackage makes the changes to the materials it will change the Built-In shader to HDRP.

3. Installing the Universal Render Pipeline (URP).
If you prefer to switch from Built-In to URP yourself, you can install "Universal RP" through the Package Manager window. Follow these steps:
- Open your project in Unity.
- Go to Window > Package Manager.
- In the list of available packages in Unity Registry, find and install "Universal RP".

4. Using the URP Render Pipeline Converter.
After installing URP, you can use the "Render Pipeline Converter" utility to convert all Built-In shaders to URP. To use this utility:
- Go to Window > Rendering > Render Pipeline Converter.
- Select the "Built-In to URP" option.
- Check "Rendering Setting", "Material Upgrade" and other items if necessary.
- After that, click "Initialize Converters", wait for the operation to complete and click "Convert Assets".
After this procedure the tool will enable URP in your project and change the shaders on all materials from Built-In to URP.

5. Installing the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP).
If you prefer to switch from Built-In to HDRP yourself, you can install "High Definition RP" through the Package Manager window. Follow these steps:
- Open your project in Unity.
- Go to Window > Package Manager.
- In the list of available packages in Unity Registry, find and install "High Definition RP".

6. Using the HDRP Render Pipeline Converter.
After installing HDRP, you can use the "HDRP Wizard" utility to convert all Built-In shaders to HDRP. To use this utility:
- Go to Window > Rendering > HDRP Wizard.
- Scroll down and click the "Convert All Built-In Materials to HDRP" option.
- Before click "Proceed" make sure you have a project backup before proceeding.
- If you sure - click "Proceed"
After this procedure the tool will change the shaders on all materials from Built-In to HDRP.
